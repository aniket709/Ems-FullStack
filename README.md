# CRUD Operation with Spring Boot and React.js

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend.

## Features

  - Backend (Spring Boot):
    - Implements RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations.
    - Uses Spring Data JPA for database interaction with MySQL.
    - Handles data validation, error handling, and service-layer logic.
  
  - Frontend (React.js):
    - Provides a dynamic user interface to interact with the backend API.
    - Allows users to perform CRUD operations with real-time updates.
    - Uses React Hooks and Axios for making API calls.
  
## Technologies Used

- Backend:
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Data JPA
  - MySQL
  - RESTful APIs
  - Spring Security (optional, if added)

- Frontend:
  - React.js
  - Axios (for API requests)
  - React Router (for routing)
  - Material UI or Bootstrap (optional for styling)
